Task 1: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA DATA <br>

Description: Build a sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral.<br><br>

Steps:<br>

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of social media posts with labeled sentiments.<br>
Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.<br>
Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.<br>
Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.<br>
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
Deployment: Create a simple web interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.<br><br>

Tech Stack:<br>

Python<br>
